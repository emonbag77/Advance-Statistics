# Advance-Statistics
Advance statistics deal with correlation, covariance, collinearity, hypothesis testing, ANOVA and Chi-square test.

This project shows what statistics (advance-statistics) one needs to learn in order to become a successful data scientist

In the file, the first problem includes a numerical where I have solved covariance and correlation in details. The rest are theories
about multi-collinearity problems, correlation threshold value, ANOVA, NULL and Alternate hypothesis problems.
